    <h2>Strengths and Tuning Potential</h2>
    <div class="container3">
      <h3>1. Durability & Reliability</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>OM606:</strong> Known for its bulletproof reliability, this
        engine was built for high-mileage use. Its
        <strong
          >mechanical fuel injection (on early models) and simple design</strong
        >
        make it extremely dependable. Even in tuned applications, it can handle
        <strong>500-600 hp</strong> with stock internals when equipped with a
        stronger fuel pump and turbo. <strong>2JZ:</strong> The
        <strong>2JZ-GTE</strong> features a <strong>closed-deck design</strong>,
        forged internals, and an iron block, making it one of the strongest
        gasoline engines ever made. It can handle
        <strong>800-1000 hp</strong> with stock internals, making it the go-to
        choice for high-performance applications.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Tuning & Aftermarket Support</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>OM606</strong> The tuning potential of the OM606 mainly lies in
        upgrading its turbo and fueling system. With the right setup, it can
        produce over <strong>600 hp</strong>, but aftermarket support is more
        limited compared to the 2JZ. <strong>2JZ:</strong>The 2JZ has one of the
        largest aftermarket support networks, with
        <strong
          >a vast selection of turbos, ECU upgrades, and forged
          internals</strong
        >
        readily available. Some builds push over <strong>1500 hp</strong> with
        the right modifications.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Cost & Availability</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>OM606</strong> These engines are often found in older Mercedes
        diesel sedans and are relatively <strong>affordable</strong>, making
        them a popular swap choice for budget performance builds.
        <strong>2JZ:</strong> Prices for a good-condition
        <strong>2JZ-GTE</strong> have skyrocketed due to demand. A stock
        <strong>2JZ-GTE can cost $8,000+</strong>, whereas a
        <strong>naturally aspirated 2JZ-GE</strong> is still more affordable but
        requires significant upgrades to match the GTE’s strength.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Fuel Economy & Daily Usability</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>OM606:</strong> As a diesel, the OM606 offers
        <strong>superior fuel economy</strong> and torque at low RPMs, making it
        an excellent choice for daily driving and off-road builds.
        <strong>2JZ:</strong> 2JZ, especially the <strong>GTE</strong>, is more
        performance-oriented and consumes more fuel, particularly when tuned.
      </p>

      <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>OM606:</strong> Commonly used for
        <strong
          >off-roading (Mercedes G-Wagen builds), diesel drift cars, and even
          swaps into trucks and SUVs</strong
        >
        due to its torque and reliability. <strong>2JZ:</strong> A staple in the
        <strong>drag racing, drift, and street performance scene</strong>, often
        swapped into <strong>Supras, Skylines, BMWs, and even trucks</strong>.
      </p>
      <h2>Which One Should You Choose?</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>OM606</strong> is best for those who want
        <strong
          >a reliable, fuel-efficient, and high-torque diesel engine</strong
        >
        that can handle turbo upgrades for serious power. It’s ideal for
        <strong
          >off-roaders, overlanders, and unique diesel performance
          builds</strong
        >. The <strong>2JZ</strong>, on the other hand, is the ultimate choice
        for those seeking
        <strong>high-revving, extreme performance applications</strong> with
        unparalleled aftermarket support. If you’re into
        <strong>street racing, drag racing, or drifting</strong>, the 2JZ is
        unbeatable. In the end,
        <strong>both engines are legendary in their own right</strong>, and the
        best choice depends on your goals and preferences!
